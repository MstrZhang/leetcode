# leetcode

these are my solutions to the [blind 75](https://leetcode.com/discuss/general-discussion/460599/blind-75-leetcode-questions) leetcode questions. i write my solutions in [python](https://www.python.org/) (and sometimes [javascript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) if i feel like it / have time). i'd recommend doing the questions in the order outlined by [grind 75](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/grind75) as it has a natural progression of difficulty + skill building

solutions all work and pass all leetcode test cases. may not be the most efficient. i try and provide explanations and time / space complexity analyses per question. i might push solutions to interesting problems outside of this set of problems
